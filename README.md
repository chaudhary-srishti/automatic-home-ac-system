# Automatic Home Air Conditioning System

### Problem Description
The goal of this project is to provide end users with a home air conditioning system that will regulate the environment that it is used in, such as in living spaces. This product will control the temperature and maintain it at comfortable temperatures set by the user. It will also aim to provide the user with information regarding their environment, such as temperature and humidity, so that they may better understand the spaces that they are in. This product should also give the user complete control over every aspect of their environment when it comes to regulating the temperature to their liking.

### How to run:
1. The program works with JDK 19 or above.
2. We have added four test case files in the repo: testCase1.txt, testCase2.txt, testCase3.txt, testCase4.txt
3. To test different modes, change the testCaseNum of Main.java (line 14) to the to the desired test case number.
4. The console will provide the values of the thermostat (user input values), the value of room temperature and humidity as well as the state of the cooler, heater and fan.
